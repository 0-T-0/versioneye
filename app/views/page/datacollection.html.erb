	the Service Provider. These messages may include, among others but not limited to, news, current
	developments, technical notes, tips and other information about services, including future services
	offered by the Service Provider. In addition to solely information, the Service Provider shall be entitled
	to also include advertising for its own and/or third-party products in these messages.
</p>
<p>
	This shall also be valid for information from companies with which the Service Provider is affiliated
	or cooperates (e.g. partners) insofar as the Service Provider may consider this to be appropriate
	subject to its consideration of all circumstances in my interest. The Service Provider shall be entitled
