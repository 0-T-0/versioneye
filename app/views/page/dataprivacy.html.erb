<h2>The collection and use of non-personal data for internal system and statistical purposes</h2>
<p>
When you access our web-site, your Internet browser automatically transmits data to our server for technical reasons. Amongst other items, this data includes the date and time of the access, the URL of the web-site directing you to us, the file you access, the volume of data sent, the type and version of your browser, your operating system and your IP address. This data is stored separately from the other data you enter while us- ing our web-site. It is not possible for us to attribute this data to a specific person. The data contains no information whatsoever which allows back-tracking to a specific per- son. The data is collected and used exclusively for statistical and analytical purposes, for example about how the service can be improved; it is deleted after use.
</p>
<h2>The collection and use of personal data</h2>
<p>
We only collect and use your personal data (for example, your name and email address) if you enter this data in an entry field, send us an email with an enquiry, make use of our services and proposals and send this to us and if you have explicitly consented to the collection and use of this data.
</p>

<h2>Data already in our possession</h2>
<p>
In so far as a contractual relationship is to be formed between you and us, developed in terms of content or amended, we collect and use your personal data in so far as is necessary for the achievement of this purpose.
If so ordered by the relevant authorities, we may disclose items of this data (data al- ready in our possession) on a case by case basis in so far as is necessary for the pur- pose of criminal prosecution, the avoidance of danger, to enable the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution or the Military Counter-Intelligence Service to perform their statutory duties or for the purpose of the assertion of intellectual property rights.
</p>
<h2>Usage data</h2>
<p>
We collect and use your personal data in so far as is necessary to enable you to use our web-services (usage data). This data particularly includes information on the be- ginning, end and extent of the use of our services.
For the purposes of promotion, market research and designing our web-services to suit demand, we are allowed to create usage profiles using pseudonyms. You have the right to object to this use of your data at any time. We will not, and indeed are not allowed to link this usage profile with data about the person behind the pseudonym. 
</p>

<h2>Transmission of personal data to third parties</h2>
<p>
No personal data is passed to third parties if you have not registered with us. In the event that you register for the use of our service, please note the explicit statement of consent which also includes consent for the onward transmission of data.
</p>
<h2>Right of rescission</h2>
<p>
You have the right at any time to revoke the consent you have given for the collection and use of personal data from that point in time onwards. You can contact us for this purpose by post or by email at contact@versioneye.com.
The revocation of the statement of consent means that the account is terminated at the same time and that you lose the ability to use the service.
</p>

<h2>Right to information</h2>
<p>
You have the right to require information on the data which is saved relating to your person or your pseudonym. If you so require, the information can also be sent to you electronically. You can contact us for this purpose by post or by email at contact@versioneye.com.
</p>
<h2>Deletion of the data</h2>
<p>
The personal data which has been saved is deleted if you revoke your consent to it be- ing saved, if information about you is no longer necessary to achieve the purpose be- ing pursued by saving the data or if saving the data is or becomes inadmissible for other legal reasons.
</p>

<h2>Objection to the commercial use of our contact data</h2>
<p>
The use of our contact data published in our Legal Notices section or in comparable statements, such as postal addresses, phone and fax numbers as well as email ad- dresses, by third parties for the transmission of information which has not been ex- pressly requested is not permitted unless we have previously given our express written consent or unless a business relationship already exists. If this prohibition is breached we expressly reserve the right to take legal steps against persons sending so-called SPAM emails. The service provider and all persons named in this web-site hereby ob- ject to any commercial use and dissemination of their data. 
</p>
<h2>Cookies &amp; other technical measures</h2>
<p>
What are called “temporary cookies” are used to make navigation easier when individ- ual sites are accessed. The cookies in our web-site do not collect any personal data about you and are completely anonymous. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any viruses. You can prevent the installation of cookies by setting your browser software appropriately. However, we wish to point out that in this case you may not be able to use all the functions of this web-site to their full extent. Technical measures, for example Java Applets or Active-X-Controls, which enable the user‘s access pattern to be reproduced are not used.
</p>
<h2>Google Analytics</h2>
<p>
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. (“Google“). Google Analytics uses cookies i.e. text files which are saved in your computer and which enable the use of the web-site to be analysed. The information generated about your use of this web-site (including your IP address) is transferred to a Google server in the USA where it is saved. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the web-site in order to compile reports on web-site activity for the web-site operator and to perform additional services associated with the use of the web-site and the Internet. If necessary, Google may also relay this information to third parties in so far as this is al- lowed by law or to the extent that third parties process this information on behalf of Google. In no case will Google link your IP address with other data which Google saves. You can prevent the installation of cookies by setting your browser software ap- propriately. However, we wish to point out that in this case you may not be able to use all the functions of this web-site to their full extent.
</p>
<p>
We have also set up Google Analytics in such a way that the complete IP address is not saved or processed; the last byte of the visitor‘s IP address is automatically re- moved by Google Analytics before the IP address is used and saved.
</p>
<p>
The Google Analytics function can now be deactivated in all commonly used browsers by means of a browser add-on. Thus, if you wish, you can you can very easily prevent analysis information from being sent to Google merely by installing this browser add- on. This possibility now exists for Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera.
